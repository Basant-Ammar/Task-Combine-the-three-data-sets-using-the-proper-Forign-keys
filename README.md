# README - Data Merging Project

## Overview
This project is a Jupyter Notebook that processes and merges multiple datasets from an Excel file using Python and the Pandas library. The dataset consists of sales data, product information, and salesperson details.

## Features
- Reads an Excel file containing multiple sheets.
- Loads sales, product, and salesperson data.
- Merges the datasets using common keys (`ProductKey` and `EmployeeKey`).
- Displays the merged dataset for further analysis.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python (>=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas library
- Google Colab (optional, if running on Colab)

## Installation
1. Install Python if not already installed: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas jupyter
   ```
3. If running on Google Colab, upload the Excel file manually.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Dr_Basant.ipynb`).
2. Run the first cell to import necessary libraries.
3. Upload the Excel file when prompted (if using Google Colab).
4. Execute the subsequent cells to read, process, and merge the datasets.
5. Analyze the final merged dataset.

## File Structure
- `Dr_Basant.ipynb` - Main Jupyter Notebook for data processing.
- `Merge Two Data Sets Using Python (1).xlsx` - Excel file containing the datasets.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by improving the data merging process, adding visualizations, or optimizing performance.
